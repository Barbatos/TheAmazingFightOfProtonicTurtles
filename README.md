The Amazing Fight Of Protonic Turtles
================================

"The Amazing Fight of Protonic Turtles" is a 2D game in C using the SDL lib that I developed for my 1st year project at the University. 

The design was made by my girlfriend Lisa Bekdache.

The software is under the GNU GPL licence.
